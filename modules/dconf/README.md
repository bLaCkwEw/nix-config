I can't seem to get the dconf home-manager module to work, so I'm just going to add the exported keybinds here, with instructions on how to restore them.


**kbd-settings**
```sh
dconf load /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/ < kbd-settings.txt
```

**kbd-shortcuts**
```sh
dconf load /org/gnome/shell/keybindings/ < kbd-shortcuts.txt
```

**kbd-wm**
```sh
dconf load /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/ < kbd-wm.txt
```
